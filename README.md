Hello! If you're reading this, you've stumbled across my first attempt at creating a git repo. 

Sooo....yay.

Anyway, this project uses an Arduino, a RTC (Chronodot), and a few I2C-controlled RGB 'pixels' to display the time.

This Instructable was the inspiration for this project:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Ghetto-Pixels-Building-an-open-source-BlinkM/

Instead of showing numbers, each of the three pixels (hours, minutes, seconds), cycles through the color spectrum, starting at red. Not horribly practical, and not horribly original, but it's fun to watch and a fun project that features the integration of several different components.
